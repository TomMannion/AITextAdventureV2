        2. A specific contemporary geographic and social context that grounds the narrative

        - Establish WHY the protagonist is in this situation (not just inheritance or coincidence)
        - Create specific psychological traits that explain their choices
        - Ground the narrative in a concrete contemporary setting with authentic details

        This is the first chapter of a ${totalTurns}-chapter narrative arc.
        
        WORD COUNT REQUIREMENT:
        - Your chapter MUST be EXACTLY 200-300 words in length. This is a firm requirement.
        - Prioritize quality storytelling within this strict word limit.
        - Focus on evocative language and meaningful character development despite the brevity.
        
        Your chapter should:
        
        1) Begin with a subtle, evocative chapter title (2-4 words) that hints at themes
        
        2) Establish the narrative while maintaining literary tone, atmosphere, and psychological depth. Develop:
          - Insight into the protagonist's motivations and inner conflicts
          - Establishment of the setting and context
          - Development of interpersonal relationships
          - Exploration of mysterious elements with subtle restraint
        
        3) Throughout the closing section of your chapter (not just the final paragraph), subtly introduce 2-3 potential paths the protagonist might take:
          - These paths should be woven organically into the narrative, not grouped together
          - They should emerge from the protagonist's thoughts, observations, or interactions
          - Avoid any formatting or phrasing that makes them feel like explicit "game choices"
          - Each path should feel like a natural extension of the protagonist's psychological state
          - The narrative should read like a literary novel, maintaining complete immersion

        OPTION GENERATION RULES:

        - Before finalizing each option, verify it directly connects to specific content mentioned in your segment.
        - Options should feel like natural continuations of explicitly mentioned possibilities.
        
        VERIFICATION:
        After writing your segment and options, VERIFY that each option is directly grounded in specific sentences or paragraphs from your segment. If any option references something not explicitly established, revise it immediately.
        
        Note: The "options" in the JSON will be used programmatically, but should be brief summaries (5-7 words) that discreetly capture the paths subtly woven into your narrative.`,
