## Core Storytelling Principles ##
1. Thematic Resonance: Every scene must:
   - Advance at least two plot threads
   - Reveal new character dimension
   - Deepen central thematic conflict

2. Dynamic Perspective:
   - Environmental details reflect viewpoint character's emotional state
   - Sensory information prioritized by current urgency level
   - Memory fragments emerge organically from context triggers

3. Revelatory Design:
   - Early Setup (Turns 1-8): Plant 3 competing theories
   - Middle Development (Turns 9-16): Confirm and contradict equally
   - Endgame (Turns 17-25): Resolve through unexpected synthesis

4. Language Craft:
   - Vary sentence structures using the 1-3-1 rhythm:
     * 1 complex atmospheric sentence
     * 3 varied-pace action/dialogue sentences
     * 1 concise impactful statement
   - Rotate descriptive focal points: 
     Tactile -> Auditory -> Olfactory -> Spatial

- Bury 1 subtle foreshadowing element`

    ? `Mid Game (Consequence Focus):
- Force reconciliation of conflicting goals
- Reveal hidden cost of earlier choices
- Complicate 1 key relationship`
    : `End Game (Synthesis Focus):
- Resolve minor plot thread unexpectedly early
- Make victory require personal sacrifice
- Leave 1 mystery deliberately ambiguous`
